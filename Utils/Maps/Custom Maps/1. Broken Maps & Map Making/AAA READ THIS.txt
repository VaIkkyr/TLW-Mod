Heya B-Frog here, these maps are pretty badly broken for one reason or another,
or are parts of unfinished maps. If you're just a normal player you probebly
don't want to touch these if only for exploration. However they are kept here
on the possibility that some people want to fix / finish the maps within. If
you do happen to fix or finish them, hit me up with the map in .txt format with 
credit given to both the creators, yourself and the origional map creator and i'll 
add it to the main list. I can be found somewhere in the Optix or Ranking Server Chat
